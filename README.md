# Smoke-Detection-Using-Webcam-Based-Spectrometer
The webcam-based smoke detection system analyzes optical spectral plots from a light source, such as an LED, to identify smoke. By monitoring how smoke affects light intensity and alters the spectrum, the system detects when intensity reaches a pre-defined threshold. Upon detection, the system generates warnings that correspond to varying levels of smoke hazard, enabling early fire detection and minimizing potential damage and loss of life.
